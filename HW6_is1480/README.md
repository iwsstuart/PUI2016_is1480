# HW6

### Assignment 1

Due to extenuating circumstances (and deadline extension) I was forced to work mostly on my own for this part of the assignment. I consulted with Shay Lehmann on my method
for importing the PLUTO data to my project folder.

### Assignment 2

Since I had worked on my own to create a hypothesis and prepare the CitiBike data in homework 3, I completed the analysis on my own - incorporating
suggestions from the review by @rvecsler. The data was completely prepped to perform a z-test, so additional steps were minimal.

# FBB good.
