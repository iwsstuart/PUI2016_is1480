## HW9

I did this assignment mostly on my own due to schedule constraints. It was a good exercise in working with Numpy arrays, and I used the online Numpy documentation for guidance. Not all of what I learned is evident in the notebook, as I tried numerous methods that did not end up being directly useful for these tasks but surely will be in the future.
