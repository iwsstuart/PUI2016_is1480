## HW10

The purpose of this exercise was to compare the spatial autocorrelation of CitiBike ridership between summer and winter months. Winter and summer were crudely defined as October-March and April-September, respectively. The global spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) was found to be very similar for both seasons - 0.645 for summer and 0.660 for winter. When using the LISA method to look at local spatial autocorrelation, we can also see that there is minimal difference between summer and winter by looking at the mapping of "hot and cold" spots.

This assignment was completed individually.
