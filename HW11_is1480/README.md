## HW11

For this assignment I worked mostly alone (again, I know) due to prior commitments during working hours on Monday and Tuesday. As far as the process, there was some initial difficulty in Assignment 1 creating the loop to identify the tract that contains CUSP. This was resolved with a slightly different method than was suggested in the assignment outline. In Assignment 2, the difficulties were mostly around data acquisition and munging, with many issues arising along the way that were trivial but took time to resolve.
